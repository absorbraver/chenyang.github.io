# Career
I am now a 4th year student in a 5 years' Ph.D. program in Empowerment Informatics at University of Tsukuba. I am studying at [Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://www.ai.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/index.html) supervised by [Prof. Kenji Suzuki](http://www.ai.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/kenji/index.html). I am involed in a standing mobility device project [Qolo: A Standing Mobility Vehicle](http://www.ai.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/research/046.html) now.  During Augest 2019 - Octoer 2019, I was a visiting student at [LASA](http://lasa.epfl.ch/) supervised by [Prof. Aude Billard](http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=115671) in EPFL. My research interest includes Human-machine interaction, Autonomous docking, 3D image processing, Control theory and so on.

Before joining this lab, I was in a bachelor's pilot program in engineering (Mechanical Engineering and Automation) in Jilin University, China. My bachelor graduate project was done under supervision by Prof. [DongF. Wang](https://teachers.jlu.edu.cn/dongfwang).
