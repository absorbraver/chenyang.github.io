I am now a 2rd year student in a 5 years' Ph.D. program in Empowerment Informatics in University of Tsukuba. I am studying at [Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://www.ai.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/index.html) supervised by [Prof. Kenji Suzhuki](http://www.ai.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/kenji/index.html). I am involed in a standing mobility device project [Qolo: A Standing Mobility Vehicle](http://www.ai.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/research/046.html) now. My research interest includes Human-machine interaction, Autonomous docking, 3D image processing and so on.

Before joining this lab, I was in a bachelor's pilot program in engineering (Mechanical Engineering and Automation) in Jilin University, China.
